## Basic commands

**Attention, [TARS-CLI](https://github.com/tars/tars-cli) is the preferred
 way to work with TARS. It is faster and more comfortable to work with TARS-CLI. All commands are available and [described in TARS-CLI](https://github.com/tars/tars-cli/blob/master/docs/en/commands.md), so use only TARS-CLI for working with your project. TARS used Gulp to start tasks, when CLI was not created.**

`gulp init` â€” initializes project with the specified settings in the tars-config. Creates a file structure.

`gulp re-init` â€” **This command is deprecated!** reinitialize the project with specified settings in the tars-config. It is advised to use this command if you initialize the project with incorrect options. **Attention, files from pages and static folder will be deleted.**

`gulp` or `gulp build` â€” build project. Non-minimized files are used by default. Build type depends on command parameters.
Available parameters:

* `--min` â€“ minimized files are connected to html.
* `--release` â€“ minimized  files are connected to html whose names have hash. This mode is useful if you are trying to directly deploy ready markup to the server.

`gulp dev` â€” initialize of builder in development mode. Dev-version of the project is created  without any minifications. It also launches watchers for project files.
Available parameters:

* `--lr` â€“ initialize livereload (live page reloads with changes in project files), if it is included in the configuration of the project.
* `--tunnel` â€“ initialize project with markup sharing to the external web.

The link will be shown in the console. There also will be a link to the control panel for devices to which markup is shared.

`gulp build-dev` â€” generation of dev-version of the project without watchers.

These parameters are available in any mode of assembly:

* `--ie8` â€“ to include in the build styles for ie8.
* `--ie9` â€“ to include in the build styles for ie9.
* `--ie` â€“ to include in the build styles for ie8 and ie9.
